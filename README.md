Wordpress-Hacks
===============

Common admin hacks I add to Wordpress for security and customisation

The sections are laid out as follows:

theme/    functions.php extras for theming (though some such as login could be put in a module)
myplugin/ content related extras such as creating new content types 
          (which you don't want to lose if you change your theme)
          For your own theme, change all examples of myplugin and EXAMPLE (for images and URLs)

TO ADD:
htaccess (common htaccess hacks such as changing the uploads folder)
